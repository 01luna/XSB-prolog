This is a set of tests for the XSB system.  To run all the tests:

testsuite.sh <xsb-executable>

where EXECUTABLE is the full path for the XSB executable to be
tested. It must be given by an absolute filename, since the testsuite
script changes directories.

The testsuite script creates a file in the /tmp dir
(/tmp/xsb_test_log.$USER) with the log of the run. In case any test
fails, the script will automatically notify the user who started it.

Another test script is supertest.sh. It configures XSB with several
different parameters and then runs the test suite using each.
This is done as follows:

supertest.sh <xsb-executable> <xsb-root-directory>
