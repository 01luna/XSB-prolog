This is a set of tests for the XSB system.  To run all the tests:

testsuite.sh XSB-INSTALL-DIR [CONFIGURATION-TAG]

where XSB-INSTALL-DIR is the full path for the XSB installation directory.
The CONFIGURATION-TAG is optional. It is what the user might specify using
--config-tag 

The testsuite script creates a file in the /tmp dir
(/tmp/xsb_test_log.$USER) with the log of the run. In case any test
fails, the script will automatically notify the user who started it.

Another test script is supertest.sh. It configures XSB with several
different parameters and then runs the test suite using each.
This is done as follows:

supertest.sh XSB-INSTALL-DIR
