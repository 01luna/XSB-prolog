% An instruction `check_interrupt' has to be just added before
% `new_answer_dealloc', because there is no more `call's before an
% answer is put into the answer table.  For example, in the following
% example, if we don't add `check_interrupt' before
% `new_answer_dealloc', verify_attributes/2 will be called after the
% WRONG answer p(X) (where X is still an attv) has been put into the
% answer table.

:- table p/1.

p(X) :- X = 5.
