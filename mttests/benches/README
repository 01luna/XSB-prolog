To run the these scripts.

In you xsb directory $XSB, make sure you have make xsb with four
different configurations:

	default configuration, 
	--enable-mt
	--enable-batched-scheduling
	--enable-batched-scheduling --enable-ccmpl.

run the script: 

overhead.sh $XSB $DIR

where directory_name is the name of a subdirectory (in the current
path) into which intermediate results will be stored.  

To output the results in latex readable format, run the script:

format_anal.sh $DIR

(Currently, for the mac not all benchmarks run for batched, and I've
had to comment out a few tests -- other platforms may be different).
