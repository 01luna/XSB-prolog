1. Check the file 

       config/x86-pc-windows/config.h

   You may have to change some variables there. These variables have
   comments that explain the purpose of each variable that might need to be
   changed.

   When done, copy this file to emu/configs/config.h

2. Check the file 

       config/x86-pc-windows/configuration.P

   Again, some variables there might need to be changed.

3. IF YOU ARE DEBUGGING:
   Check the files in emu/debugs/ and DEFINE the appropriate debugging
   flags.

4. To be figured out.
