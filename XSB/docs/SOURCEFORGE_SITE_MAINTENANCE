As of 2007 the old homepage/SOURCEFORGE_SITE_MAINTENANCE seems
out-dated.  Among other things, shadow_site is owned by lfcastro, so
the approach of checking things into CVS does not work in general.
Nor could I get cvs to work directly under htdocs.

So, to update the web page do the following steps.

-- make whatever changes you need in docs/newpages, and when you are
   done update cvs.

-- log in to shell.sourceforge.net as xsb then cd to xsb/htdocs (full
path is /home/groups/x/xs/xsb/htdocs).  Copy into the staging directory any
of the .html or other files you need.  Eg. 

scp about.html xsb@shell.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/x/xs/xsb/htdocs/staging

-- Add the release file following the instructions of:

https://sourceforge.net/docs/E01/en/#top

-- There are several other directories that may need to be updated.

api -- has generated documentation for XSB
manual1 -- subdirectory for manual vol. 1
manual2 -- subdirectory for manual vol. 2
packages -- subdirecotry for packages manuals

-- Finally, update the news.  Login to sourceforge, under the admin
menu, click news, then submit.  this will bring you to a form where
you can submit the news story.
