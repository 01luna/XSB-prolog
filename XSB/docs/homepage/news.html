<b>XSB version 1.8.1 is now released!</b><p>

Version 1.8.1 is a minor release after version 1.8.  Besides some bug
fixes, the main new feature of this version is the support for <A
HREF="http://dev.servisoft.pt/interprolog">InterProlog</A> -- A Java
front-end and enhancement for Prolog. <p>

If you are tired of running XSB in a text console, or want to use XSB to
develop applications with nice GUI interface, you may want to download
XSB version 1.8.1 together with InterProlog.  For more information about
InterProlog, please visit its web site <A

To get more information about the XSB system, please take a look at the
<A HREF="rel_notes.html">Release Notes of Version 1.8</A>.  <p>

We are still working on the XSB manual for version 1.8.1 and will put it
online once it is done.
