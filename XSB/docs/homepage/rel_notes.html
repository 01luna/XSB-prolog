<h1> Release Notes for Version 2.2.1</h1></center>

<h3> General</h3>
This is primarily a maintenance release.

<h3>News</h3>
<ul>
<li> The XSB libwww package that first appeared in XSB 2.2.1 now has interface
to the RDF parser provided by the libwww package from W3C.
</ul>

<h3>Backward Incompatibility</h3>
The type <tt>bool</tt> used by the external C interface has been replaced with
xsbBool, because of clashes with various include files that exist on some
platforms. Likewise, the macros for dealing with the variable string type used
by C programs that call XSB as a library have been renamed. For instance,
<tt>vstrDEFINE</tt> is now <tt>XSB_StrDefine</tt>. See Vol. 2 of the manual for
the new names.

<h1> Release Notes for Version 2.2</h1></center>

<h3> General</h3>

<h3>News</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Support of Attributed Variables:</b> Attributed variables are now
supported in XSB (partially compatible with SICStus 3.8).  See <a
href="manual/manual2.pdf">XSB Manual, Voulume 2, Attributed
Variables.</a>
<li><b>Random Number Generator:</b> A builtin random number generator is
implemented, and a set of predicates, which are compatible with SICStus
3.8, are provided.
</ul>


<h3>New Packages</h3>
<ul>
<li>
    <b><tt>libwww</tt></b> - a powerful Web access package.
    See <a href="manual/manual2.pdf">XSB Manual, Voulume 2, The Libwww
    Package.</a>
    This package has been tested only on Solaris 2.6 and Linux 2.2.
    It definitely needs configuration work in order to run under Windows.
    <br>
    This XSB package relies on the W3C's libwww library and requires it to
    be installed. The entire package is implemented in C and is much faster
    than other related Internet access packages for Prolog, e.g., PiLLOW). The
    package provides the following functionality: 
    <ul>
    <li> HTML parser.
    <li> (Non-validating) XML parser (including handling of external entities).
    <li> The ability to simultaneously dispatch several HTTP requests and parse
         the responses as they arrive; no waiting until the entire
	 document is received.
    <li> Fetching web pages and filling out forms.
    <li> Header information.
    <li> Timeouts.
    <li> Basic and digest  authentication. SSL to follow.
    <li> Redirection.
    <li> Error handling.
    </ul>

</ul>

<h3>Backward Incompatibility</h3>

<ul>
<li>
    The C calls <tt>xsb_query_string_string</tt> and <tt>xsb_next_string</tt>
    that interface C programs to XSB now use the new <tt>VarString</tt> data
    type instead of <tt>char*</tt>. 
    It is no longer necessary to pass the size of the buffer to these
    functions. See XSB Manual, Volume 2, to learn more about the
    variable-length string data type.
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Crashing of XSB-ODBC interface under Windows;
<li>Memory violations of some internal operations on delay lists.
</ul>

<h3> General</h3>

<h3>News</h3>

<p>
<b>Process management API:</b> XSB can now spawn subprocesses and capture their
standard I/O into XSB streams. This allows XSB to communicate with other
processes. See <a href="manual/manual2.pdf">XSB Manual, Voulume 2, Communication
with Subprocesses.</a>

<p>
<b>XSB preprocessor:</b> There is now a compiler option, <tt>xpp_on</tt>, which
tells the XSB compiler to put the source through a preprocessor. The default is
<a href="http://www.math.polytechnique.fr/cmat/auroux/prog/gpp.html">gpp</a>, a
powerful preprocessor that understands both C and Prolog syntax.

<p>
<b>High-level C interface:</b> XSB can now automatically generate wrappers for
the most common C functions. Such functions can now be simply declared using
compiler directives and then be called from XSB.

<p>
<B>Enhancements to the sockets interface:</B>
New calls such as <tt>socket_set_option, socket_select,</tt>, etc.
Certain socket calls and file I/O calls can be timed-out.

<p>
<b>I/O enhancements:</b>
There are several additions to the low-level I/O library, such as
<tt>file_clone, file_reopen, pipe_open</tt>.
Certain socket calls and file I/O calls can be timed-out.

<p>
<b>New section on string manipulation in manual part 2:</b>
Some of the predicates described there are old (but weren't documented) and
some are new.

<p>
<b>Call changes:</b>
New calls: number_digits/2, number_codes/2, atom_codes/2 replace atom_chars/2
and number_chars/2.

<p>
<b>Atom length:</b>
Atom length in compiled code is no longer limited to 255.
The 255 limit on the size of ldoptions directive in the Foreign C interface
has been removed as well.

<p>
<b>Debugger enhancements:</b>
Many additional options: profiling, verbose skip, extensive trace control
facility.

<h3>New Packages</h3>

<p>
<b>sModels</b>: Implements stable model semantics.

<h3> Backward Incompatibility</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> 
   <b>Binary incompatibility!!!</b>
   The format of the XSB .O files has been changed. Make sure you recompile
   all your programs! (The binaries that come with the XSB distribution have
   the new format.)
<li>
  <tt>unix/1</tt> is now called <tt>shell/1</tt>. It exists in module
  <tt>shell</tt>, and is imported from there automatically.
<li>
  The standard predicates
  atom_chars/2 and number_codes/2 now behave as in the Prolog standard (return
  lists of atoms rather than ASCII codes).
  The old behavior is provided by the standard predicates atom_codes/2 and
  number_codes/2.
<li>
  A number of backward-incompatible changes in socket calls.
  First, the predicates socket_send_eof/1 and socket_send_asci/2 have been
  removed. This functionality is available through other calls.
  <p>
  Second, all socket predicates now have an extra argument, the error code.
  The old-style predicates have been preserved, but their behavior isn't
  guaranteed to be 100% the same. The fileptr argument in socket_connect call
  has been deleted. The fileptr argument in socket_accept no longer denotes an
  XSB I/O port. Instead, it denoted a socket descriptor. It can be converted to
  an I/O port using the new builtin fd2ioport.
  <p>
  socket_send/3 no longer appends the message delimited (the backquote).
  Programs that rely on this feature will not work any longer.
  Instead of this old hack, socket_send now prepends a 4-byte header that
  specifies the length of the message body. The primitive socket_recv/3 uses it
  to determine the length of the message it received.
</ul>

<h1> Release Notes for Version 2.0</h1></center>

<h3> General</h3>
<p>
<font size=+0>XSB Version 2.0 offers a more flexible handling of dynamic code.
XSB now also includes a number of preprocessors that allow it to
efficiently evaluate powerful formalisms such as F-logic, Annotated logic, and
the well-founded semantics with explicit negation.  Finally, XSB 2.0 provides
various packages for regular expression and wildcard matching.

<p>&nbsp;Large parts of XSB have been rewritten for this release, especially&nbsp;
memory management, and representation of tabled clauses.&nbsp; The result
is a more robust system with improved functionality that is more suitable
for use in commercial and large-scale research development.
<br>&nbsp;

<p>
Added support for <a href="http://dev.servisoft.pt/interprolog">InterProlog</a>,
a Java front-end enhancement for Prolog</li>


<h3> Packages</h3>
Version 2.0 of XSB includes the following packages:
<ul>
<li>
 <i>FLORA</i>: A full-fledged F-logic to XSB compiler and shell.
<li> <i>GAP</i>: support for annotated logic programming.
<li> <i>SLX</i>: allows XSB to evaluate extended logic programs according to
the well-founded semantics with explicit negation.
<li> <i>PARLMATCH</i>: an interface to Perl pattern matching and
string substitution capabilities.
<li> <i>REGMATCH</i>: provides similar functionality,
but relies on a POSIX-compliant C library instead of Perl.
<li> <i>WILDMATCH</i>: allows matching wildcards and globbing of directories.
Relies on a POSIX 2 compliant C library.
</ul>

<h3> Backward Incompatibility</h3>
<p>
The following incompatible changes have been made in XSB Version 2.0:
<ul>
<li>
    The file .xsbrc in the home directory is no longer used. Instead, XSB
    now uses the directory .xsb/ and the startup file is .xsb/xsbrc
    It is now possible to have pretty much any Prolog code in that file.
<li>
    There is a change in how the library_directory predicate is used.
    The user must now assert directories into this predicate.
    There is no need to export this predicate (this predicate is now
    global).
<li>
    XSB is no longer supported on MS DOS.
<li>
    In order to be consistent with the ISO Prolog standard, XSB no
    longer supports mixing compiled and dynamic code for the same
    predicate. 
<li> 
    The predicate is_string/1, which used to check if its argument is a list of
    characters, is now replaced by the builtin is_charlist/1. There is now also
    is_charlist/2 (see the manual).
</ul>
