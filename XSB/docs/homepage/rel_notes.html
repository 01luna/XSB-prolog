Release Notes for Version 2.0</h1></center>
<font size=+0>Version 2.0 of XSB, a Prolog-based Logic Programming System,
is now available. XSB extends the standard functionality of Prolog to include
implementations of tabling (through SLG resolution),<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
a more flexible handling of dynamic code,&nbsp;</font> and full compilation
of HiLog terms.<font face="Times New Roman,Times"> In addition, XSB offers
a number of interfaces that make it able to call -- or be called by --
other software systems.&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp; XSB includes a set of preprocessors
that allow it to efficiently evaluate powerful formalisms such as F-logic
and the well-founded semantics with explicit negation.</font></font>
<p>&nbsp;Large parts of XSB have been rewritten for this release, especially&nbsp;
memory management, and representation of tabled clauses.&nbsp; The result
is a more robust system with improved functionality that is more suitable
for use in commercial and large-scale research development.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="SECTION00002000000000000000"></a>Tabled Resolution</h3>
Tabled resolution is useful for recursive query computation, allowing programs
to terminate correctly in many cases where Prolog does not. Users interested
in Parsing, Program Analysis, Model-checking, Data Mining and Diagnosis
may benefit from XSB.
<p>XSB's Tabling implementation:
<ul>
<li>
Evaluates at the engine level programs with stratified and non-stratified
negation, and programs with stratified aggregation.</li>

<li>
Allows full Prolog functionality in tabled code including cuts, (subject
to weak semantic restrictions), in meta-logical predicates, in second-order
predicates, etc.</li>

<li>
Allows for declaration of tabled predicates either automatically by the
system or manually by the user. Furthermore, tabling can be automatically
performed for termination, for efficiency, or for both.</li>

<li>
Provides standard tabling predicates which can be used to program a number
of applications in Non-Monotonic reasoning and Knowledge representation.</li>

<li>
Dynamically compiles tables into trie-based SLG-WAM code. which is indexed
dynamically and for which full memory management is provided.</li>

<li>
Finally, Version 2.0 includes an alternative tabling strategy called <i>Local
Evaluation</i> which can be extremely efficient for applications such as
program analysis, along with an alternative memory model, called Chat,
which allows garbage colleciton during tabled evaluations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="SECTION00003000000000000000"></a>Indexing of Dynamic Code</h3>
XSB contains a variety of features to support in-memory data-oriented applications.
Using these features, knowledge bases of up to one million clauses can
be quickly loaded and efficiently indexed.
<ul>
<li>
XSB provides a variety of read and assert mechanisms for quickly loading
dynamic predicates, especially if these predicates are unit clauses.</li>

<li>
Indexes can be created on alternate or joint arguments of dynamic code.
Furthermore this indexing can be hash-based, or trie-based if it is necessary
to perform indexing deep within a term.</li>

<li>
For static code XSB provides <i>unification factoring</i> which extends
clause indexing by factoring common unifications out of clause heads, and
can be used to optimize many Prolog programs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="SECTION00002000000000000000"></a>HiLog Compilation</h3>
HiLog supports a type of higher-order programming in which predicate symbols
can be variable or structured. This allows unification to be performed
on the predicate symbols themselves in addition to the arguments of the
predicates.
<p>XSB's HiLog implementation:
<ul>
<li>
Includes compiled HiLog. Higher-order predicates execute at essentially
the same speed as compiled first-order predicates.</li>

<li>
Includes a fully integrated HiLog preprocessor. HiLog terms can be used
anywhere in XSB, including the interpreter level.</li>

<br>Provides a number of meta-logical standard predicates for HiLog terms.</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="SECTION00002000000000000000"></a>Interfaces</h3>
Supported interfaces for XSB include:
<ul>
<li>
Interfaces to call C functions or to be called by them, under UNIX.</li>

<li>
An interface to Oracle that</li>

<ul>
<li>
efficiently generates SQL code for Prolog queries on-demand, making use
of Level 4 of Oracle's ProC.</li>

<li>
translates Datalog clauses into SQL automatically.</li>

<li>
makes public all source-code so that the interface can be tuned as needed,
or can be ported to other Prologs.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Support for <a href="http://dev.servisoft.pt/interprolog">InterProlog</a>,
a Java front-end enhancement for Prolog</li>

<li>
A DLL interface so that XSB can be called from within a Windows application.</li>

<li>
An ODBC interface, to call data stored by other Windows applications.</li>

<li>
An interface to call Perl applications and library routines</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="SECTION00004000000000000000"></a><b><font size=+3>Packages</font></b></h3>
Version 2.0 of XSB includes the FLIP package that allow XSB to allow queries
to F-logic programs, and the SLX library that allows XSB to evaluate extended
logic programs according to the well-founded semantics with explicit negation.
<p>XSB has been tested on over a dozen hardware and operating system platforms
under DOS, Microsoft Windows, Windows NT, and various versions of 32-bit
UNIX. Version 1.8 has been rewritten to run under 64-bit architectures
and has been tested on 64-bit SGI machines. Various versions of XSB have
been used to construct large-scale commercial systems for the U.S. Customs
Service, the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency, the National Security Agency,
and Medicine Rules, Inc.
<p>XSB is available via the web from <tt>http://www.cs.sunysb.edu</tt>.
and through anonymous ftp from <tt>ftp.cs.sunysb.edu.</tt>
