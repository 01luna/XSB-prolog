<center> <h1>Release Notes of Version 1.8</h1> </center>
<HR>

Version 1.8 of XSB, a Prolog-based Logic Programming System, is
now available.  XSB extends the standard functionality of Prolog to
include implementations of tabling (through SLG resolution), full
compilation of HiLog terms, and a more flexible handling of dynamic
code.  In addition, XSB offers a number of interfaces that make it
able to call -- or be called by -- other software systems.
<P>
The main improvements of Version 1.8 over previous versions are its
improved Local Evaluation scheduling strategy, the addition of ODBC and
DLL interfaces, its ability to run on 64-bit architectures and expanded
libraries -- such as the WFSX preprocessor -- along with general
improvements for robustness and speed.
<P>



<H3><A NAME="SECTION00001000000000000000">Tabled Resolution</A></H3>
<P>
Tabled resolution is useful for recursive query computation, allowing
programs to terminate correctly in many cases where Prolog does not.
Users interested in Parsing, Program Analysis, Model-checking, Data
Mining and Diagnosis may benefit from XSB.
<P>
XSB's Tabling implementation:
<UL>
<LI> Evaluates at the engine level programs with stratified and
non-stratified negation, and programs with stratified aggregation.
<LI> Allows full Prolog functionality in tabled code including cuts,
(subject to weak semantic restrictions), in meta-logical predicates,
in second-order predicates, etc.
<LI> Allows for declaration of tabled predicates either automatically
by the system or manually by the user.  Furthermore, tabling can be
automatically performed for termination, for efficiency, or for both.
<LI> Provides standard tabling predicates which can
be used to program a number of applications in Non-Monotonic reasoning
and Knowledge representation.
<LI> Dynamically compiles tables into trie-based SLG-WAM code.
which is indexed dynamically and for which full memory management is
provided.
<LI> Finally, Version 1.8 includes an improved and robust version of
an alternative tabling strategy called <EM>Local Evaluation</EM> which
can be extremely efficient for applications such as program analysis.
</UL>




<H3><A NAME="SECTION00002000000000000000">HiLog Compilation</A></H3>
<P>
HiLog supports a type of higher-order programming in which predicate
symbols can be variable or structured.  This allows unification to be
performed on the predicate symbols themselves in addition to the
arguments of the predicates.
<P>
XSB's HiLog implementation:
<UL>
<LI> Includes compiled HiLog.  Higher-order predicates execute at
essentially the same speed as compiled first-order predicates.
<LI> Includes a fully integrated HiLog preprocessor.  HiLog terms can
be used anywhere in XSB, including the interpreter level.
<LI> Provides a number of meta-logical standard predicates for HiLog
terms. 
</UL>




<H3><A NAME="SECTION00003000000000000000">Indexing of Dynamic Code</A></H3>
<P>
XSB contains a variety of features to support in-memory data-oriented
applications.  Using these features, knowledge bases of up to one
million clauses can be quickly loaded and efficiently indexed.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> XSB provides a variety of read and assert mechanisms for quickly
loading dynamic predicates, especially if these predicates are unit
clauses.
<LI> 
Indexes can be created on alternate or joint arguments of dynamic
code.  Furthermore this indexing can be hash-based, or trie-based if
it is necessary to perform indexing deep within a term.
<LI> 
For static code XSB provides <EM>unification factoring</EM> which extends
clause indexing by factoring common unifications out of clause heads,
and can be used to optimize many Prolog programs.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="SECTION00004000000000000000">Interfaces</A></H3>
<P>
Supported interfaces for XSB include: 
<UL>
<LI> Interfaces to call C functions or to be called by them,
	under UNIX.
<LI> An interface to Oracle that
<UL>
<LI> efficiently generates SQL code for Prolog queries
	on-demand, making use of Level 4 of Oracle's ProC.
<LI> translates Datalog clauses into SQL automatically.
<LI> makes public all source-code so that the interface can
	be tuned as needed, or can be ported to other Prologs.
</UL>
<LI> A DLL interface so that XSB can be called from within a
	Windows application.
<LI> An ODBC interface, to call data stored by other Windows
	applications.
</UL>
<P>
XSB has been tested on over a dozen hardware and operating system
platforms under DOS, Microsoft Windows, Windows NT, and various
versions of 32-bit UNIX.  Version 1.8 has been rewritten to run under
64-bit architectures and has been tested on 64-bit SGI machines.
Various versions of XSB have been used to construct large-scale
commercial systems for the U.S. Customs Service, the U.S. Defense
Logistics Agency, the National Security Agency, and Medicine Rules,
Inc.
