<h1> Release Notes for Version 2.0</h1></center>

<font size=+0>XSB Version 2.0 offers a more flexible handling of dynamic code
and full compilation of HiLog terms. In addition, XSB offers a number of
interfaces that make it able to call -- or be called by -- other software
systems. XSB 2.0 now also includes a number of preprocessors that allow it to
efficiently evaluate powerful formalisms such as F-logic, Annotated logic, and
the well-founded semantics with explicit negation.  Finally, XSB 2.0 provides
various packages for regular expression and wildcard matching.

<p>&nbsp;Large parts of XSB have been rewritten for this release, especially&nbsp;
memory management, and representation of tabled clauses.&nbsp; The result
is a more robust system with improved functionality that is more suitable
for use in commercial and large-scale research development.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="SECTION00002000000000000000"></a>Tabled Resolution</h3>
Tabled resolution is useful for recursive query computation, allowing programs
to terminate correctly in many cases where Prolog does not. Users interested
in Parsing, Program Analysis, Model-checking, Data Mining and Diagnosis
may benefit from XSB.
<p>XSB's Tabling implementation:
<ul>
<li>
Evaluates at the engine level programs with stratified and non-stratified
negation, and programs with stratified aggregation.</li>

<li>
Allows full Prolog functionality in tabled code including cuts, (subject
to weak semantic restrictions), in meta-logical predicates, in second-order
predicates, etc.</li>

<li>
Allows for declaration of tabled predicates either automatically by the
system or manually by the user. Furthermore, tabling can be automatically
performed for termination, for efficiency, or for both.</li>

<li>
Provides standard tabling predicates which can be used to program a number
of applications in Non-Monotonic reasoning and Knowledge representation.</li>

<li>
Dynamically compiles tables into trie-based SLG-WAM code. which is indexed
dynamically and for which full memory management is provided.</li>

<li>
Finally, Version 2.0 includes an alternative tabling strategy called <i>Local
Evaluation</i> which can be extremely efficient for applications such as
program analysis, along with an alternative memory model, called Chat,
which allows garbage colleciton during tabled evaluations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="SECTION00003000000000000000"></a>Indexing of Dynamic Code</h3>
XSB contains a variety of features to support in-memory data-oriented applications.
Using these features, knowledge bases of up to one million clauses can
be quickly loaded and efficiently indexed.
<ul>
<li>
XSB provides a variety of read and assert mechanisms for quickly loading
dynamic predicates, especially if these predicates are unit clauses.</li>

<li>
Indexes can be created on alternate or joint arguments of dynamic code.
Furthermore this indexing can be hash-based, or trie-based if it is necessary
to perform indexing deep within a term.</li>

<li>
For static code XSB provides <i>unification factoring</i> which extends
clause indexing by factoring common unifications out of clause heads, and
can be used to optimize many Prolog programs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="SECTION00002000000000000000"></a>HiLog Compilation</h3>
HiLog supports a type of higher-order programming in which predicate symbols
can be variable or structured. This allows unification to be performed
on the predicate symbols themselves in addition to the arguments of the
predicates.
<p>XSB's HiLog implementation:
<ul>
<li>
Includes compiled HiLog. Higher-order predicates execute at essentially
the same speed as compiled first-order predicates.</li>

<li>
Includes a fully integrated HiLog preprocessor. HiLog terms can be used
anywhere in XSB, including the interpreter level.</li>

<br>Provides a number of meta-logical standard predicates for HiLog terms.</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="SECTION00002000000000000000"></a>Interfaces</h3>
Supported interfaces for XSB include:
<ul>
<li>
Interfaces to call C functions or to be called by them, under UNIX.</li>

<li>
An interface to Oracle that</li>

<ul>
<li>
efficiently generates SQL code for Prolog queries on-demand, making use
of Level 4 of Oracle's ProC.</li>

<li>
translates Datalog clauses into SQL automatically.</li>

<li>
makes public all source-code so that the interface can be tuned as needed,
or can be ported to other Prologs.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Support for <a href="http://dev.servisoft.pt/interprolog">InterProlog</a>,
a Java front-end enhancement for Prolog</li>

<li>
A DLL interface so that XSB can be called from within a Windows application.</li>

<li>
An ODBC interface, to call data stored by other Windows applications.</li>

</ul>

<h3> <a NAME="SECTION00004000000000000000"></a><b> <font size=+3>Packages</font></b></h3>
Version 2.0 of XSB includes the following packages:
<ul>
<li>
 <i>FLORA</i>: A full-fledged F-logic to XSB compiler and shell.
<li> <i>GAP</i>: support for annotated logic programming.
<li> <i>SLX</i>: allows XSB to evaluate extended logic programs according to
the well-founded semantics with explicit negation.
<li> <i>PARLMATCH</i>: an interface to Perl pattern matching and
string substitution capabilities.
<li> <i>REGMATCH</i>: provides similar functionality,
but relies on a POSIX-compliant C library instead of Perl.
<li> <i>WILDMATCH</i>: allows matching wildcards and globbing of directories.
Relies on a POSIX 2 compliant C library.
</ul>

<h3> <a NAME="SECTION00004000000000000000"></a><b> <font size=+3>Backward
Incompatibility</font></b></h3>
<p>
The following incompatible changes have been made in XSB Version 2.0:
<ul>
<li>
    The file .xsbrc in the home directory is no longer used. Instead, XSB
    now uses the directory .xsb/ and the startup file is .xsb/xsbrc
    It is now possible to have pretty much any Prolog code in that file.
<li>
    There is a change in how the library_directory predicate is used.
    The user must now assert directories into this predicate.
    There is no need to export this predicate (this predicate is now
    global).
</ul>


 <p>

<hr>
 <p>
 XSB has been tested on over a dozen hardware and
operating system platforms under DOS, Microsoft Windows, Windows NT, and
various versions of 32-bit UNIX. It has been rewritten to run under
64-bit architectures and has been tested on 64-bit SGI machines. Various
versions of XSB have been used to construct large-scale commercial systems for
the U.S. Customs Service, the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency, the National
Security Agency, and Medicine Rules, Inc. 

<p>
XSB is available via the web from
<tt>http://www.cs.sunysb.edu</tt>.  and through anonymous ftp from
<tt>ftp.cs.sunysb.edu.</tt>
