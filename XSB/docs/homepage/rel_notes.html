<h1> Release Notes for Version 2.0</h1></center>

<h3> General</h3>
<p>
<font size=+0>XSB Version 2.0 offers a more flexible handling of dynamic code.
XSB now also includes a number of preprocessors that allow it to
efficiently evaluate powerful formalisms such as F-logic, Annotated logic, and
the well-founded semantics with explicit negation.  Finally, XSB 2.0 provides
various packages for regular expression and wildcard matching.

<p>&nbsp;Large parts of XSB have been rewritten for this release, especially&nbsp;
memory management, and representation of tabled clauses.&nbsp; The result
is a more robust system with improved functionality that is more suitable
for use in commercial and large-scale research development.
<br>&nbsp;

<p>
Added support for <a href="http://dev.servisoft.pt/interprolog">InterProlog</a>,
a Java front-end enhancement for Prolog</li>


<h3> Packages</h3>
Version 2.0 of XSB includes the following packages:
<ul>
<li>
 <i>FLORA</i>: A full-fledged F-logic to XSB compiler and shell.
<li> <i>GAP</i>: support for annotated logic programming.
<li> <i>SLX</i>: allows XSB to evaluate extended logic programs according to
the well-founded semantics with explicit negation.
<li> <i>PARLMATCH</i>: an interface to Perl pattern matching and
string substitution capabilities.
<li> <i>REGMATCH</i>: provides similar functionality,
but relies on a POSIX-compliant C library instead of Perl.
<li> <i>WILDMATCH</i>: allows matching wildcards and globbing of directories.
Relies on a POSIX 2 compliant C library.
</ul>

<h3> Backward Incompatibility</h3>
<p>
The following incompatible changes have been made in XSB Version 2.0:
<ul>
<li>
    The file .xsbrc in the home directory is no longer used. Instead, XSB
    now uses the directory .xsb/ and the startup file is .xsb/xsbrc
    It is now possible to have pretty much any Prolog code in that file.
<li>
    There is a change in how the library_directory predicate is used.
    The user must now assert directories into this predicate.
    There is no need to export this predicate (this predicate is now
    global).
<li>
    XSB is no longer supported on MS DOS.
<li>
    In order to be consistent with the ISO Prolog standard, XSB no
    longer supports mixing compiled and dynamic code for the same
    predicate. 
</ul>
