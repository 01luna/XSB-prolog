FLORA-2 is a sophisticated deductive object-oriented database system and
application development platform. It is implemented as a compiler that
translates a unified language of F-logic, HiLog, and Transaction Logic into
<a href="http://xsb.sourceforge.net/">
the XSB deductive engine</a>.

The programming language supported by FLORA-2 is a dialect of F-logic with
numerous extensions. Some extensions, such as path expressions, are
borrowed from <a
href="http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~dbis/">FLORID</a>.  However,
FLORA-2 has unique and powerful features not found in other deductive
object-oriented database systems.  First, as already mentioned, in addition
to F-logic, it supports HiLog and logical updates, as in Transaction Logic.
Second, FLORA-2 was designed with extensibility and flexibility in mind.
The operator grammar is carefully crafted into the language, which allows the
user to extend the syntax with her own idioms.  Third, FLORA-2 provides an
original dynamic module system, which supports modular software design and
turns it into a flexible application development platform.

Applications of FLORA-2 include Intelligent Agents, Semantic Web,
and Ontology management.

March 11, 2002: We are happy to announce the release of a "late alpha"
version of FLORA-2. This version has significantly improved stability and
several important new features. See
