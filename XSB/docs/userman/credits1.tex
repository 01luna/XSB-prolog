Day-to-day care and feeding of XSB including bug fixes, ports, and
configuration management has been done by Kostis Sagonas, David
Warren, Terrance Swift, Prasad Rao, Steve Dawson, Juliana Freire, 
Baoqiu Cui and Michael Kifer.

In \version, the core engine development of the SLG-WAM has
been mainly implemented by Terrance Swift, Kostis Sagonas, Prasad Rao
and Juliana Freire.  The breakdown, roughly, was that Terrance Swift
wrote the initial tabling engine and builtins.  Prasad Rao wrote the
trie-based table access routines, and Kostis Sagonas implemented most
of tabled negation.  Juliana Freire revised the table scheduling
mechanism starting from Version 1.5.0 to create a more efficient
engine, and implemented the engine for local evaluation.  Memory
management code for execution stacks was written by by Ernie Johnson,
Bart Demoen and Rui Marques.  Rui Marques improved the trailing of the
SLG-WAM and rewrote much of the engine to make it compliant with
64-bit architectures.  Assert and retract code was based on code
written by Jiyang Xu and significantly revised by David S. Warren and
Rui Marques.  Trie assert and retract code was written by Prasad Rao.
The command-line interface was written by Ernie Johnson.  The current
version of {\tt findall/3} was written by Bart Demoen.

In the XSB complier, Kostis Sagonas was responsible for HiLog
compilation and associated builtins.  Steve Dawson implemented
Unification Factoring.  The {\tt auto\_table} and {\tt suppl\_table}
directives were written by Kostis Sagonas.  The DCG expansion module
was written by Kostis Sagonas.  The multifile directive was written by
Baoqiu Cui.  C.R. Ramakrishnan wrote the mode analyzer for XSB.  The
safety check for tabling within the scope of cuts was written by Kate
Dvortsova.

Michael Kifer rewrote much of the XSB code to make XSB complient with
GNU's autoconfig routines.  Harald Schroepfer helped the XSB group
with the Solaris port, and Yiorgos Adamopoulos suggested the bits to
use for the HP-700 series port.  Steven Dawson, Larry B. Daniel and
Franklin Chen were responsible for the MkLinux and Solaris x86 ports.

The starting point of XSB (in 1990) was PSB-Prolog 2.0 by Jiyang Xu.
PSB-Prolog in its turn was based on SB-Prolog, primarily designed and
written by Saumya Debray, David S. Warren, and Jiyang Xu.  Thanks are
also due to Weidong Chen for his work on Prolog clause indexing for
SB-Prolog and to Richard O'Keefe, who contributed the Prolog code for
the Prolog reader and the C code for the tokenizer.
