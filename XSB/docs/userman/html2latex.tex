%  Default is no indenting for paragraphs, and paragraphs separated by

%
%  We treat line breaks a bit carefully, because we want to be able to
%  remove them before <HR> in particular.  In order to do this, we
%  leave a special mark after a forced line break so we can recognize
%  it later.  To remove the break, we look for the special marker, and
%  if it is there, remove the marker and the line break.

%  To format a text field, set \tt font, and get the width of a space.
%  Multiply this by the number of characters in the field and add two
%  more (I suppose we could have used em's here throughout, oh well).
%  Draw the underline (slightly below the baseline) and the add a

%  field

%
%  For a checkbox, make sure we're in horizontal mode, then make a box

%
%  The check bullet mark is a solid square

%
%  This routine draws a boder around a box.  The border is separated
%  from the contents of the box by the amount of space specified in
%  #1.  The width of the line is the standard .4pt.  The baseline of
%  the constructed box should be the baseline of the material
%  containined within it.

%  This routine is used to contruct special symbols like the checkbox
