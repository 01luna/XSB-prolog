<h1>ChangeLog</h1>

<h2> Version 3.3.X (Pignoletto)</h2> 

<h3> Version 3.3.5</h3> 
<ul>
<li> The port of XSB to 64-bit Windows has been hardened so that XSB
can call external C functions, and its configuration process improved.
</li>
<li> The initial version of a new tracing facility for computations,
called <i>forest logging</i> is now available for use.
</li>
<li> A new predicate, called <tt>table_dump/[1,2,3]</tt> allows easy
introspection of XSB's tables.  In addition, new builtins 
<tt>is_cyclic/1</tt> and <tt>term_depth/2</tt> are now available.
</li> 
<li> Configuration of the latest version of XSB on the latest version
of Cygwin is now working again.
</li>
<li> Numerous bug fixes and specialized enhancements, the most
  widespread of which were: Improving the module inferencing used by
  XSB's compiler; improving XSB's exception handling when large
  computations use all available memory; improved messages for term
  depth exceptions.
</li>
</ul>

<h3> Version 3.3.4</h3> 
<ul>
<li> XSB now includes a Java-based installer for Windows 32- and
64-bits, and for several varieties of Linux.
</li> 
<li> XSB now allows a compier option indicating that the input file is
canonical, which can improve the speed of compilation of files in
canonical form by 10-20\%.
</li> 
<li> New flags allow users to automatically fail, warn, or throw an
error whenever trying to add to a table an answer whose depth is above
a given threshold.  Separate flags are provided for lists and non-lists.
</li>
<li> Garbage collection time for abolishing tables is now maintained
for statistics.</li>
<li> <tt>load_dyn/[1,2]</tt> can now dynamically load a file into a
module.</li>
<li> Several bug fixes, including the following.  An obscure bug in
handling unsafe variables.  A bug that somtimes occured when adding
conditional answers with answers in the head but not in the delay
lists.  Arrays used in interning an answer or trie term with a very
large number of variables, are now expanded when necessary. </li>
<li> Minor changes were made to make errors that have to do with
tabling show the actual call that generated the error, rather than
just the predicate.</li>
</li> 


</ul>

<h3> Version 3.3.3</h3> 
<ul>
<li>
XSB is now supported on 64-bit Windows platform, either in 64-bit or
in 32-bit mode under MSVC compilation.  Similar support has been
available for Linux and Mac OS X for several years.  During the
porting process to Windows, several small bugs were fixed for all
64-bit platforms.
</li>
<li>
A new table inspection
predicate <tt>variant_get_residual(Call,DelayList)</tt> can be used to
return (possibly conditional) answers for a table that is a variant
of <tt>Call</tt>
</li>
<li>
Prolog commons libraries are now included with the distribution.
</li>
</ul>

<h3> Version 3.3.2</h3> 
<ul>
<li>
XSB and its packages are now significantly easier to compile on
Windows using the MSVC compiler.
</li>
<li>
Fix to allow XSB to be compiled on the Mac with very recent changes to
 Apple's xcode.  These xcode changes broke backwards compatability!
</li>
<li> Fix for recently introduced bug that broke XSB embedability into
C programs on Linux.  In addtion a fix allows XSB to exit cleanly in
32-bit Linux when tagged address space has been exceeded.
</li>
<li>
<tt> url_encode/2 </tt> and <tt> url_decode/2</tt> are now standard predicates.
</li>
<li>A queryable trace log facility is now available do aid debugging.
<li>
Minor bug fixes and enhancements: 
<ul>
<li>Fixed core dump that arose from poor error handling when
univ was called using a list whose length was greater
than <tt>MAX_ARITY.</tt>
</li>
<li>
Simplification stack is now dynamically expandable (this should only
affect programs that make extremely heavy use of well-founded
negation).
</li>
<li><tt>pretty_print/2</tt> now implemented to pretty print to a stream.</li>
</li>
<li>
XSB now treats <tt>0'\s</tt> as a space to improve compatability with
some other Prologs.
</li>
<li>
Patch level added into the Prolog commons flag <tt> version_data</tt>;
patch date is now a part of the XSB banner.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3> Version 3.3.1</h3> 
<ul>
<li>
Bug fixes for incremental tabling that arose when explicitly
 abolishing invalidated incremental tables.  Inclusion of information
 about incremental tables in statistics when relevant.
</li>
</ul>

<h3> Version 3.3.0</h3> 
<ul>
<li>
Bug fixe for incremental tabling when evaluating programs with tabled
negation.
</li>
<li>
Fix for bug under 32-bit Linuxes when allocating very large chunks of
memory.
</li>
<li>
Inclusion of number of SCCs of non-completed tabled subgoals into
XSB's statistics.
</li>
<li>
Fix in proc_files library for loading csv files into Prolog predicates.
</li>
<li>
Fixes for various bugs when using CLP(R) with tabling.  Update of
CLP(R) package to include newest changes from SWI repository.  Changes
to CLP(R) package to allow a smaller, and user-defined epsilon.
</li>
<li>
Changes to attribute API to make this XSB's API similar to that of SWI
and YAP (and perhaps others).  Made term_variables/2 standard as it is
in other Prologs.
</li>
</ul>
