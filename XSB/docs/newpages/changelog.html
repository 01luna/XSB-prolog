<h1>ChangeLog</h1>

<h2> Version 3.3.X (Pignoletto)</h2> 

<h3> Version 3.3.2</h3> 
<ul>
<li>
XSB and its packages are now significantly easier to compile on
Windows using the MSVC compiler.
</li>
<li>
Fix to allow XSB to be compiled on the Mac with very recent changes to
 Apple's xcode.  These xcode changes broke backwards compatability!
</li>
<li> Fix for recently introduced bug that broke XSB embedability into
C programs on Linux.  In addtion a fix allows XSB to exit cleanly in
32-bit Linux when tagged address space has been exceeded.
</li>
<li>
<tt> url_encode/2 </tt> and <tt> url_decode/2</tt> are now standard predicates.
</li>
<li>A queryable trace log facility is now available do aid debugging.
<li>
Minor bug fixes and enhancements: 
<ul>
<li>Fixed core dump that arose from poor error handling when
univ was called using a list whose length was greater
than <tt>MAX_ARITY.</tt>
</li>
<li>
Simplification stack is now dynamically expandable (this should only
affect programs that make extremely heavy use of well-founded
negation).
</li>
<li><tt>pretty_print/2</tt> now implemented to pretty print to a stream.</li>
</li>
<li>
XSB now treats <tt>0'\s</tt> as a space to improve compatability with
some other Prologs.
</li>
<li>
Patch level added into the Prolog commons flag <tt> version_data</tt>;
patch date is now a part of the XSB banner.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3> Version 3.3.1</h3> 
<ul>
<li>
Bug fixes for incremental tabling that arose when explicitly
 abolishing invalidated incremental tables.  Inclusion of information
 about incremental tables in statistics when relevant.
</li>
</ul>

<h3> Version 3.3.0</h3> 
<ul>
<li>
Bug fixe for incremental tabling when evaluating programs with tabled
negation.
</li>
<li>
Fix for bug under 32-bit Linuxes when allocating very large chunks of
memory.
</li>
<li>
Inclusion of number of SCCs of non-completed tabled subgoals into
XSB's statistics.
</li>
<li>
Fix in proc_files library for loading csv files into Prolog predicates.
</li>
<li>
Fixes for various bugs when using CLP(R) with tabling.  Update of
CLP(R) package to include newest changes from SWI repository.  Changes
to CLP(R) package to allow a smaller, and user-defined epsilon.
</li>
<li>
Changes to attribute API to make this XSB's API similar to that of SWI
and YAP (and perhaps others).  Made term_variables/2 standard as it is
in other Prologs.
</li>
</ul>
