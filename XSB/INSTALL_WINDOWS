	INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS OR DOS
	--------------------------------------------


1. Check the file 

       emu/configs/config.h

   You may have to change some variables there. The variables are commented
   so hopefully it should be clear how things might need to be changed.
   The part of the file where changes are allowed is clearly marked.

2. Check the file:

   Windows:
       config/x86-pc-windows/configuration.P
   Dos:
       config/x86-pc-pcdos/configuration.P

   Again, some settings there might need to be changed.
   The file is commented and the part that might need to be changed is
   clearly marked.

3. IF YOU ARE DEBUGGING:
   Check the files in emu/debugs/ and DEFINE the appropriate debugging
   flags. In particular, the DEBUG flag in emu/debugs/debug.h must be set.

4. If you change the XSB scheduling strategy (batched to local or vice
   versa)  in 1 and 2 or if you are changing the compilation mode from
   DEBUG to optimized, then please also update the file

   Windows:
	 config/x86-pc-windows/banner.msg
   DOS:
	 config/x86-pc-pcdos/banner.msg

   The only purpose of this update is to ensure that the user doesn't get
   an incorrect banner message on startup.

5. To be figured out.
