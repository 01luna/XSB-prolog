	INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS OR DOS
	--------------------------------------------


1. Check the file 

       emu/configs/config.h

   You may have to change some variables there. The variables are commented
   so hopefully it should be clear how things might need to be changed.
   The part of the file where changes are allowed is clearly marked.

2. Check the file:

   Windows:
       config/x86-pc-windows/configuration.P
   Dos:
       config/x86-pc-pcdos/configuration.P

   Again, some settings there might need to be changed.
   The file is commented and the part that might need to be changed is
   clearly marked.

3. IF YOU ARE DEBUGGING:
   Check the files in emu/debugs/ and DEFINE the appropriate debugging
   flags. In particular, the DEBUG flag in emu/debugs/debug.h must be set.

4. If you change the XSB scheduling strategy (batched to local or vice
   versa)  in 1 and 2 or if you are changing the compilation mode from
   DEBUG to optimized, then please also update the file

   Windows:
	 config/x86-pc-windows/banner.msg
   DOS:
	 config/x86-pc-pcdos/banner.msg

   The only purpose of this update is to ensure that the user doesn't get
   an incorrect banner message on startup.
   Changing this files alone won't enable debugging and/or local scheduling 
   strategy. You must also recompile XSB with these options enabled.

5. If you downloaded a precompiled version of XSB, you are done.
   If you need to recompile XSB, then read (6).

6. Compile the ./emu directory.

   Windows:
	Load the files in the emu\ directory into C++ studio.
	Add the files in emu\debugs and emu\configs directories.
	Add winsoc32.lib library to the list of libraries to be linked with.
