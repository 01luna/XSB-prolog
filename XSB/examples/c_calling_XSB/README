This directory contains examples that show how to call XSB from C.

All these programs assume that they are compiled and placed in the XSB
directory for executables, $XSB_HOME/config/<your system architecture>/bin

A sample Makefile for Linux to build these examples is provided.
The Makefile specific to your architecture is placed in
    $XSB_HOME/config/<your system architecture>/modMakefile
after you build XSB.

It contains all the right settings, but you will have to fill in the actual
name for the program that calls XSB.
