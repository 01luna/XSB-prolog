These instructions are for installing versions of FLORA outside of the XSB
distribution tree.

If you installed a full version of XSB and intend to use FLORA-2 from
there, you don't need to do anything -- just skip the instructions below.


If you have downloaded an interim release of FLORA-2 from
http://flora.sourceforge.net or a development version from
the CVS repository there then you can configure FLORA-2 as follows.

1. Untar/download FLORA-2 into a directory *outside* of the XSB
   distribution tree, say FLORA:

   	cd FLORA
	tar xzf flora2.tar.gz  (or use WinZip, under Windows)

   This will create a subdirectory, flora2; it is the top directory of your
   new installation of FLORA-2.

2. Change to the top directory of the new FLORA-2 installation:

   	cd flora2

   Type
	makeflora clean
	makeflora path-to-call-xsb
   
   The path to the XSB executable is typically something like .../XSB/bin/xsb
   or D:\XSB\bin\xsb.bat
   If you have XSB executable or its invocation script somewhere on your
   PATH, then you can configure FLORA-2 by simply typing

   	makeflora

3. After the installation, the shell script `runflora' (runflora.bat under Windows)
   will be created.
   Use it to run this version of FLORA-2.
