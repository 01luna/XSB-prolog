These instructions are for installing development versions of FLORA, which
are intended to be installed in a directory outside of the XSB distribution
tree.

If you installed a full version of XSB and intend to use FLORA-2 from
there, you don't need to do anything -- just skip the instructions below.


If you have downloaded an interim release of FLORA-2 from
http://flora.sourceforge.net or a development version from
the CVS repository there then you can configure XSB as follows.
(These instructions are presently for Unix only.)

1. Untar/download FLORA-2 into a directory *outside* of the XSB
   distribution tree.
2. Change to the top directory of your new FLORA-2 installation.
   Type
	makeflora all path-to-call-xsb
   
   The path to the XSB executable is typically something like .../XSB/bin/xsb
   If you have XSB executable or its invocation script somewhere on your
   PATH, then you can configure FLORA-2 by simply typing

   	makeflora

3. After the installation, the Unix shell script `runflora' will be created.
   Use it to run this version of FLORA-2.
