    Note: all .flh files in this directory are generated from the
    corresponding .fli files by the Makefile at the time Flora is
    installed.
    The .flh files are cleaned up by the "clean" target of the makefile.

How trailers are used:

1. Trailers in closure/ are included in compiled program.
2. Trailers in trailer/ are compiled for module main and are dynamically
   loaded in the shell when it starts.
3. Trailers in .xsb/flora/ are compiled dynamically for the appropriate
   module when an executable instruction ?- equality ... [in module]
   is executed.

Instead of mechanism (1), we could have used (3), but (1) is going to
give a slightly better time for loading. At the expense of having worse
compile time because XSB has to compile the trailers for multiple modules
multiple times.
