%%% ==================================================================
%%% So you're familiar with RELATIONAL OPERATORS and want to know the 
%%% corresponding rules? Here are some illustrative EXAMPLES:
%%%
%%% This has nothing to do with F-logic, actually
%%% ==================================================================

%%% SELECT some tuples from p(X,Y):
ans_sel(X,Y) :- p(X,Y), not X=Y.

%%% PROJECT on the first argument of p(X,Y):
ans_proj(X) :- p(X,Y).		

%%% JOIN p(A,B), q(C,D) wrt. B and C: 
ans_join(X,Y,Z) :- p(X,Y), q(Y,Z).

%%% PRODUCT of p(X) and q(Y):
ans_prod(X,Y) :- p(X), q(Y).

%%% UNION of p(X), q(X): 
ans_union(X) :- p(X).
ans_union(X) :- q(X).

%%% INTERSECTION of p(X), q(X):
ans_intersect(X) :- p(X), q(X).

%%% SET-DIFFERENCE p(X) \ q(X):
ans_diff(X) :- p(X), not q(X).


%%% ==================================================================
%%% Here are some base facts.
%%% ==================================================================

%%% p(X,Y):
p(a,a).
p(a,b).
p(b,c).

%%% q(X,Y).
q(a,e).
q(b,f).

%%% p(X):
p(a). p(b). p(c).

%%% q(X):
q(b). q(d).


%%% ==================================================================
%%% now you may ask:
%%% ==================================================================


    ?- ans_sel(X,Y).
    ?- ans_proj(X).
    ?- ans_join(X,Y,Z).
    ?- ans_prod(X,Y).
    ?- ans_union(X).
    ?- ans_intersect(X).
    ?- ans_diff(X).
