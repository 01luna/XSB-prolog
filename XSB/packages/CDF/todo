Paper

tt irel, schrel, etc.
Updating OMS for paper.

---------------------------------------------------
Doc

doc -- is ontology model defined?

Doc: oms => CDF.

Index External View Documentation.

Log in doc. etc.

Ontology vs. OMS instance vs. OMS state.

Make sure ive mentioned product identifiers, and direct constituents.

---------------------------------------------------
OMS changes to update for paper.

make sure omsext can read relation and subrel.

---------------------------------------------------

Component changes.

Does update_components create internal component info?

Intentional rules -- product classes get only direct dependencies.

in fast_merge, decode whether we need to do an OMS_update or just an
assert.

Components: 

Probably need a component dirty for dump component or dump new version.

-- Renaming.  

3) Merge Components.

-- Keeping track of files.

-- Update_all.

-- Second and third argument inheritance for strels.

1)  DB updatable.

2)  DB storage.



--------------------------------------------------------------
Other: 

Updating intensional rules.

Synthesize retractallXXX with obliterateXXX.

Maybe get rid of schema + data files?

strelschrels.  Constraints on strels?

Need consistency checking in newRelName newStrelName.

might need newCrel.

get rid of [] (no.. clause).

-----------------------------

update_components/2, fail if subdependencies are not
themselves components.

Incorporate antirelationships in create_component, etc.

Do I have an obj_nidbound?
cp_product_object_extoms 

-----------------------------

Bug in dump_oms.P (save state).

Take indices out of oms_io.P

locks

Do something better with friendly atom codes.

Is external conversion appropriate with objects in dump_omext?

Should we disallow v x v bindings in immediate_subclass,
immediate_membrof?

intensional -- get_object_int(Oid,Name,NatId,Source)

OMS Root for unk in immed. memberof
---------------------------------------

Primitive Classes (No parameterized types).
1) Add necessary conditions.
	Each class can have more than one necessary condition.
	Revise subsumption algorithm, 
	Propagation to Objects.
	Checking consistency,
	Querying algorithm

2) Add Rules for Primitive Classes.
	Write to see what a class subsumes.

3) Defined Classes.
	Start to incorporate these into rest of CDF.

Would like to prove equivalence of irels with exists and schrels with
alls.  We can prove that for a primitive class

P \subseteq exists(R,C) == irel(P,necess_cond,C)

and also that 

P \subseteq exists(R,P') == irel(P,R,P')

P \subseteq all(R,P') == schrel(P,R,P')

Subsuming: 
  Do I need to check subsumption against other defined classes?
How to represent defined classes?
A class can have at most 1 definition -- need to enforce.
A defined class can have no immediate memberofs.

Probably need to check for 2-way subsumption in definitions.

Problems with queries.

Check up on NewAttribute

Exceptions with Harpreet

Find out abt. OMS RDF

1) Add relations for Class Expressions
	Rectify class expressions

2) Figure out about class rules.

exists(uncle,male) \subseteq exists(parent,exists(brother,male))

exists(uncle,male) \subseteq exists(parent,
                                    exists(broter,(exists(spouse,male))))

X subset Y and X subset Z => X subset (Y or Z).

Applying rules: 
	
	Find everything that the right hand side subsumes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Queries: 

Make it transparent when we can deal with a source or a class.

Dont know if this is quite right:
@item @tt{attr(id(Source,Ssrc),id(Relation,Rsrc),id(Target,Tsrc))}
assumes that @tt{Source} is an object.

Don't know if we can have an attribute as well as an attribute object.

In query interface, change args.

add is_object to query interface.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

oms_filters  pair to key probably doesnt work.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Documentation -- can I make the query interface the main one?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Components -- inverse or not.  Add inverse.

new_oms: put oms_db_updatable into new_oms.
