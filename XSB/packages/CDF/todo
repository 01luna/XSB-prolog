Should we disallow v x v bindings in immediate_subclass,
immediate_membrof?

intensional -- get_object_int(Oid,Name,NatId,Source)

memberof oms_root as default.  change from unk.

think hard about changing intensional stuff.





Primitive Classes (No parameterized types).
1) Add necessary conditions.
	Each class can have more than one necessary condition.
	Revise subsumption algorithm, 
	Propagation to Objects.
	Checking consistency,
	Querying algorithm

2) Add Rules for Primitive Classes.
	Write to see what a class subsumes.

3) Defined Classes.
	Start to incorporate these into rest of CDF.

Would like to prove equivalence of irels with exists and schrels with
alls.  We can prove that for a primitive class

P \subseteq exists(R,C) == irel(P,necess_cond,C)

and also that 

P \subseteq exists(R,P') == irel(P,R,P')

P \subseteq all(R,P') == schrel(P,R,P')

Subsuming: 
  Do I need to check subsumption against other defined classes?
How to represent defined classes?
A class can have at most 1 definition -- need to enforce.
A defined class can have no immediate memberofs.

Probably need to check for 2-way subsumption in definitions.

Problems with queries.

Check up on NewAttribute

Exceptions with Harpreet

Find out abt. OMS RDF

1) Add relations for Class Expressions
	Rectify class expressions

2) Figure out about class rules.

exists(uncle,male) \subseteq exists(parent,exists(brother,male))

exists(uncle,male) \subseteq exists(parent,
                                    exists(broter,(exists(spouse,male))))

X subset Y and X subset Z => X subset (Y or Z).

Applying rules: 
	
	Find everything that the right hand side subsumes.

Queries: 

Make it transparent when we can deal with a source or a class.

Dont know if this is quite right:
@item @tt{attr(id(Source,Ssrc),id(Relation,Rsrc),id(Target,Tsrc))}
assumes that @tt{Source} is an object.

Don't know if we can have an attribute as well as an attribute object.

In query interface, change args.

add is_object to query interface.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe some problem with standardize value.

Adding singly-sourced ordsets.
  -- should ordsets be a primitive type?
  -- how do you specify the elements of a domain?
  -- should we keep these elements as numbers or in external form?
     (and so convert set/2 -> set/1.
  -- oms_primitive class for sets?

Think about sending indexing to a separate file.

oms_filters  pair to key probably doesnt work.

at some point check the tms_ stuff in this dir and take out.

Database.

make sure we execute an obdc_close on halt.

ODE port

ode_genrepsoms: genreps_properties -- cant we rewrite with sources?

replacements: find out about these, including number context.

genreps_properties: dont need is_a_relation.

question on ode initialization.

Ode abbreviation - hasODEAbbreviation

A:SNS , A:SNS:All-All

A:Suture, nonabsorbable, surgical:all-all ->
A:suture,nonabsorbable,surgical -> ODE abbreviations.

Now, all-all has many ode abbreviations to atoms.
And 'ode word' is Suture, nonabsorbable, surgical.

New stuff gensubdomains, genpardomains
Why not call for add_replace?

genreps_enum_domains == ENUM.

parser:processtms: Description string -- why variable?

what class should an ODC Description be? ODE?

Question abt processomsData: schema info?

Extract property value pairs: paramtype.

Question on nsns_rel -- what shd be output?  OMS_par among others.
elim_variants probably can be removed.

question on rel_format nid/name of objects.
