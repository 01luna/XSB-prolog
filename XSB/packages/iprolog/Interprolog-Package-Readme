	Changes made to add Interprolog as Package in XSB
	-------------------------------------------------

For adding interprolog as a package in XSB the following modifications
has been done:

1. Copy the iprolog subdirectory in XSB/packages/.

2. Add a bootstrapping file for interprolog. For this bootstrap_package
   predicate is invoked with arguments as the name of the package "iprolog"
   and the source directory as "iprolog/com/declarativa/interprolog".
   Also interprolog.P is consulted here, so any of its predicates can be 
   invoked from XSB shell.

3. Add interprolog to  packages/Makefile, so it would be compiled with
   make, while making xsb.

4. Create a Makefile in the interprolog directory for compilation of
   java and prolog source code and generating the jar file for
   interprolog in XSB/packages/iprolog.

With all these above changes, now while making XSB, when packages are
made interprolog is also built and creates the interprolog.jar file.
Now "iprolog" can be loaded as a package.
