Generic
- Speed up grammar
- Term template <-> specific Java class, using low level j2xsb-like primitives ??
- testing and shell scripts for Linux
- test all scripts on 2000, 98, Linux
- File consulting is not controllable regarding syntax errors etc, if some assurance is desired assert a fact at the end and check its presence
- ints larger than 28 bits should provoke serialization grammar failure, as this condition cannot be tested on the Java side
- floats badly rounded
- ipObjectSpec/3 discovers prototypes ? To be useful seems to require recursive discovery
- extra arg in PrologEngine constructor to load interprolog.O from either jar or direct file

NativeEngine
- Implement shutdown()
- Small optimizations with arrays etc (after grammar optimization)


SubprocessEngine
- interrupt() may trash ongoing object stream communications, so sockets should be rebuilt
- UniqueObject class: breaks serialization...
- Failures at startup may go unnoticed unless you check the listener
- testInterrupt and "nowaythisisdefined" subtest in testDeterministicGoal are failing
