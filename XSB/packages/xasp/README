In order to use the Smodels interface, several steps must be
performed.  Note: this interface has not yet been ported to Windows
Cygwin.

1) Smodels itself must be compiled as a library.  In version 2.26,
this is done by typing 

make lib

in the Smodels2.26 directory (NOT this directory).  The compilation is
complete if a .libs subdirectory was created containing various
archive files.

2) XSB must be configured with the '--with-smodels=<path-to-smodels>'
option.  This will create a file 'smoMakefile' in this directory with
a variable SMODELS set to the proper path.  the proper path.  If this
doesn't work on your system, the SMODELS variable in the smoMakefile
may need to be edited by hand.

3) The Smodels files must be made available to this interface.  One
way of doing this is by executing the command

sh makelinks.sh <path-to-smodels>

4) Finally, 

make -f smoMakefile
