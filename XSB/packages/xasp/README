In order to use the XASP interface, several steps must be
performed. For information on how to compile this under Windows, read
the file README.Win32

1) SMODELS itself must be compiled as a library.  In version 2.26,
this is done by typing 

make lib

in the SMODELS directory (NOT this directory).  The compilation is
complete if a .libs subdirectory was created containing various
archive files.

2) XSB must be configured with the '--with-smodels=<path-to-smodels>'
option.  <path-to-smodels> is the path to the directory where SMODELS
has been installed and compiled.

3) Finally, type the following in this directory:

make module
