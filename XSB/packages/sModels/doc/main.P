:- comment(module," The @bf{XASP} interface provides various levels of
interfaces to Smodels (V. 2.26) API.  At the lowest level a @em{raw}
interface allows a programmer who has translated atoms of a stable
model into integer values to use the Smodels API directly.

However, most users who want to directly program with Smodels, will
likely use the @em{cooked} interface, which allows arbitrary weight
constraint rules, and in which atoms and literals are translated to
Smodels format in a transparent manner.  Using this interface,
efficient XSB-based grounders can be written for special purpose
programming tasks.

The above interfaces allow an XSB programmer to specify a program
whose stable model is to be obtained by explicitly adding rules to a
cache.  However it is often useful to @em{implicitly} set up such a
program, sending the residual program constructed by XSB during query
evaluation to Smodels.  This level of interaction is supported by the
interface to the @tt{xnmr} module which also provides a
specially-written command-line interpreter.

Examples of use of the various interfaces can be found in the
subdirectory @tt{intf_examples}").
