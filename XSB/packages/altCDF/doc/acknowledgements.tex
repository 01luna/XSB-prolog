The Coherent Description Framework, of which Cold Dead Fish is the
open-source version, was developed with funding by Medicine Rules, Inc
and major funding by XSB, Inc.  Of the functionality included in Cold
Dead Fish, most of the Type-0 interface, along with I/O routines,
etc. was developed jointly by the authors; the Type-1 interface and
reasoning routines were developed by Swift.  Tanya Vidrevich, Bob
Pokorny, and Harpreet Singh discovered many bugs during development,
and made many valuable suggestions.
