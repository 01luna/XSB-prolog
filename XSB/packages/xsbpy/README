
This new version of xsbpy works only on Ubuntu, but it is more
powerful and more stable than the original version.  However, I have
made its configuration specific to Python 3.7

First ensure that libpython 3.7 so and the appropriate versuin of
Python.h are installed.

sudo apt-get install libpython3.7-dev  

Then follow the instructions at init_xsbpy.P

% Original 

The xsbpy module can be used either on Windows or Linux x64.

To compile for Windows x64, update:
  1. the first line of xsbpym.c
  2. PYLIB path in cc/NMakefile64.mak
Then install Visual Studio nmake and run:
  nmake /f NMakefile64.mak

To compile for Linux x64, update:
1. the first line of xsbpym.c
2. the four variables in configure.ac
Then run 
  $ autoconf
  $ ./configure

Then, on either Windows or Linux, run XSB and load the module:
  [xsbpy] .
