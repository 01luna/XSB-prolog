        -main <main> [ <f1.texic> ... <fN.texic> ] 

  Generate    the main    .texic   file  for  main
  application  file   <file> and   whose component
  .texic files are <file1.texic>... <fileN.texic>.
  The optional   arguments preceded by  -l are the
  directory   paths   where   files    used   (via
  use_module/1) by the file being documented (main
  in this case) can  be found (-s is similar,  but
  putting paths in     the -s  list   flags   that
  such paths are 'system' paths). They are treated
  in the same way as 'library paths'. The optional
  arguments preceded  by -i are  the names  of the
  indices which  should be generated.  The special
  index name  'all'  results in all  indices being
  generated. -u indicates a Prolog file with defi-
  nitions to be loaded.
