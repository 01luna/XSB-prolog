FLIP is a lean, extensible, experimental, incomplete ... 

    =======================================
    >>> F-LOGIC TO XSB COMPILER <<< 
    =======================================

Use at your own risk! (on the other hand: no risk, no fun!)

FLIP stands for *F-L*ogic *I*nter*P*reter 
     (or was it *F-L*og*I*c com*P*iler? ;-)

=====================
STARTING FLIP: 
=====================

4. Start XSB:
	XSB Version ... of October 17, 1998
	[i686-pc-linux-gnu; optimal mode]
	| ?- [flip].
	[...stuff deleted...]

   At this point, you can start running Flip commands, e.g., 

        | ?- run(some_program.flp).

   You can also start the Flip interactive command loop by typing:

	| ?- flip_shell.
	FLIP> ?- 

Here, FLIP> ?- is the Flip prompt, where you can start typing F-logic queries.

Further steps (optional):


=========
GET HELP:
=========
	FLIP> ?- help.

==========
QUIT FLIP:
==========
	FLIP> ?- end.


===============
HOW FLIP WORKS:
===============

FLIP consists of: 
	flip/flpshell.P	      top-level module, provides the FLIP shell
	flip/flptokens.P      public domain tokenizer (from R. O'Keefe)
	flip/flpparser.P      DCG parser for F-Logic *with path expressions*
	flip/flpcompiler.P    compiles (flattens) rules to XSB
	flip/flputils.P	      misc utility predicates
	flip/lib/flpheader.P  header file, attached to the generated XSB code
	flip/lib/flptrailer.P trailer file, attached to the generated XSB code

There are some simple demo files. Consult
	flip/Demo/README
for more details.

When you enter 
	FLIP> ?- rundemo("file").  

the program "file.flp" is parsed (flpparser.P) and compiled (flpcompiler.P),
thereby creating the XSB file "file.P". Look at this file to
see what has become of your F-Logic program! The compilation consists
mainly of a simple flattening procedure. Next, "file.P" is compiled by
XSB (yielding "file.O") which is then executed.  If "file.flp"
contains queries, these are immediately executed during this process
(provided there are no errors).

Of course you can enter F-Logic queries (including path expression)
interactively from the FLIP shell, say:

    FLIP> ?-  X..kids[                  % Whose kids
                 self -> K;		% ... (and name the kid!)
	         hobbies ->>		% ... has hobbies
                 {H:dangerous_hobby}	% ... which are dangerous?
    ].

=====================
LIMITATIONS/TODO-LIST: 
=====================
	o PATH EXPRESSIONS IN THE HEAD are not supported 
	  (parser doesn't complain, but generated code does not yield
           intended semantics...)
	o the generated code "file.P" is not optimized for anything =B-(
	o only monotonic inheritance
	o ... many other things!

===========
KNOWN BUGS:
===========
	o rules like 
		p :- obj[].
	  do not generate code.
	o ... (I forgot about the other bugs ;-)
