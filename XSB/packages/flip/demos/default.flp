%%% ===========================================================================
%%% SOME SIMPLE EXAMPLES SHOWING SEVERAL F-LOGIC FEATURES

times_flies_like_an_arrow.		% a 0-ary PREDICATE (proposition)
fruit_flies_like_an_apple[].		% an OBJECT with empty specification []

e(a,b). e(b,a). e(b,c).			% a binary PREDICATE (graph)

tc(X,Y) :- e(X,Y).			% a RULE and ...
tc(X,Y) :- tc(X,Z), tc(Z,Y).		% ... a (doubly) RECURSIVE RULE
 
john:employee.				% INSTANCE : CLASS 
employee::person.			% SUBCLASS :: SUPERCLASS

person[age=>integer; kids=>>person].    % some (optional) SIGNATURE information

mary:employee[				% a more complex MOLECULE involving
	age->29;			% ... a SINGLE-VALUED (svd) method
	kids ->> {tim,leo};		% ... a MULTI-VALUED (mvd) method
	salary@(1998) -> a_lot		% ... a PARAMETERIZED (and svd) method
].

tim[hobbies ->> {stamps, snowboard}].	% somebodies hobbies

snowboard:dangerous_hobby.		% isn't it??

X[self->X].				% quite UNSAFE with BOTTOM-UP (e.g. FLORID!)


person[believes_in *->>			% INHERITABLE mvd method of CLASS person
       {something, something_else}].	

person[instances ->> {X}] :- X:person.  % NON-INHERITABLE mvd method of person

%%% now ask some QUERIES here (or INTERACTIVELY from the FLIP SHELL)
%%% ===========================================================================

?- times_flies_like_an_arrow.	% ==> `yes'

?- fruit_flies_like_a_banana.	% ==> `no' (and a warning)
?- call(myprint(">>> Answer NO and WARNING intended! <<<")).

?- fruit_flies_like_a_banana[].	% ==> `yes'

?- tc(X,Y).			% computes the transitive closure of e(_,_)

?- X:person.			% What persons are there?
?- person[instances ->> {X}].	% ... same Q, but asked differently (see above)

?- X[believes_in ->> {Y}].	% Who believes in what?

?- X..kids[			% Whose kids
           self -> K;		% ... (and name the kid!)
