    This directory contains the XSB compiler code.


PLEASE NOTICE:

If you change any of the files here (such as adding a new in-lined
builtin), you must follow this procedure:

	  1. Recompile with the old, working XSB compiler.
	  2. ***Important*** Recompile again with a new compiler
	     obtained in Step 1.

If you are adding a builtin to be used in the loader at an early stage, the
procedure is more cumbersome.

First, compile ./cmp/*.P files with an old, working compiler.
Then get a version of the loader that doesn't use the new builtin
(hopefully you saved the old one ;-).

Now, compile ./cmp/*.P with the new compiler and the old loader.
Finally, put the new loader in place and recompile ./syslib/*.P and
./lib/*.P with the new compiler.  Easy, heh?
