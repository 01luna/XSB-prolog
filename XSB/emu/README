       Global Variables: Because gloabl variables may need concurrency
       control to ensure thread safety, its important to keep track of
       their use in XSB.  (This can be done by the gdb "info
       variables" command).  Currently, when XSB is compiled for
       multh-threading there are about 200 of these.  These global
       variables represent process-level information and may either be
       changeable, or constant-like (not changeable after an
       initialization).

       Changeable global variables are usually protected by mutexes or
       some other concurrency control.  Constants, however are
       perfectly safe for multi-threading.  However, when updating XSB
       for new code, it is necessesary to ensure that all global
       variables are "accounted for" -- either are constants, are
       controlled by mutexes, or are safe (e.g. global counters).  In
       order to aid this process, please use these conventions for
       global variables.  

       Constant-like variables:
       
       If the variable is 
		-- a pointer to a psc Pair give it the form xxx_pscPair
		-- a pointer to a Psc record give it the form xxx_psc
		-- a pointer to a global string, give it the form xxx_string
		-- an instruction byte-code, give it the form xxx_inst
		-- a constant-like array, give it the form xxx_table.
