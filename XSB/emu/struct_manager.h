/*
 *           Generic Block-Oriented Data Structure Management
 *           ================================================
 *
 * The following structure and macros provide a uniform method for
 * managing pools of data structures allocated from the system by block
 * (rather than individually).  By following a few guidelines, the
 * implementation of any such structure with this desired allocation
 * property is simplified.
 *
 * Interface:
 * ---------
 * - SM_InitDecl(StructType,StructsPerBlock,StructNameString)
 * - SM_AllocateStruct(SM,pNewStruct)
 * - SM_DeallocateStruct(SM,pStruct)
 * - SM_DeallocateStructList(SM,pHead,pTail)
 * - SM_CurrentCapacity(SM,NumBlocks,NumStructs)
 * - SM_CountFreeStructs(SM,NumFree)
 * - SM_RawUsage(SM,TotalBlockUsageInBytes)
 * - SM_ReleaseResources(SM)
 *
 * Management Organization:
 * -----------------------
 * Blocks of structures (records) are allocated from the system, one at a
 * time, and maintained on a linked list.  The head of this list is the
 * most recently allocated block and the one from which individual records
 * are parceled out.  Deallocated records -- ones which were
 * previously-allocated but then returned to the Manager -- are maintained
 * in a list for reallocation.  Priority is given to these previously-used
 * structures during the allocation process.  The first word of a block,
 * as well as that in a deallocated record, is used as a link for chaining
 * these objects in their respective lists.  This has implications both
 * for the layout of a block and managed records.  Ramafications for the
 * latter extend only to how one wishes to return records to the Manager
 * for reallocation: one-at-a-time or list-at-a-time (see below).  The
 * allocation of a block occurs on a needs basis.  Its overall size is
 * determined by the number and size of the records it is to hold.  For
 * convenience, a field for chaining allocated structures is also
 * provided.  Note, however, that the responsibility of maintaining this
 * list rests solely with the user (read client).  Four additional macros
 * are provided for aiding in its maintenance, but it is up to the user to
 * apply them, and in a reasonable way.  Not all records will require this
 * feature, and so this field and these macros can be safely ignored.
 *
 * Use:
 * ---
 * To use, observe the following guidelines:
 *
 * 1) Declare a Structure_Manager variable for your data structure AND
 *    initialize it statically using the macro SM_InitDecl().  Provide
 *    the macro with the type of your record, the number you wish it to
 *    allocate at once, and a string which contains the name of the
 *    structure.  For example:
 *
 *         Structure_Manager mySM = SM_InitDecl(int,5,"C integer");
 *
 * 2) To obtain a new structure from your Manager, make a call to
 *    SM_AllocateStruct():
 *
 *         SM_AllocateStruct(mySM,pNewStruct)
 *
 *    If chaining of allocated structures is desired, then one can use
 *    macros SM_AddToAllocList_SL/DL to add the returned record to the
 *    head of this list.  One must define field-access macro(s) to the
 *    link field(s) of this record type for use by these list-creating
 *    macros.
 *
 * 3) If mass deallocation of a list of records is desired, then make
 *    the first field in your record the link field for supporting the
 *    list.  You may then use macro SM_DeallocateStructList():
 *
 *         SM_DeallocateStructList(mySM,pListHead,pListTail)
 *
 *    Otherwise, you'll have to deallocate them one at a time using
 *    SM_DeallocateStruct().  If these structs are maintained on the
 *    allocation chain of the Structure Manager, then they should be
 *    removed BEFORE the deallocation.  One may find the macros
 *    SM_RemoveFromAllocList_SL/DL helpful for this...
 *
 * 4) Get info about the state of the Manager using routines
 *    SM_CurrentCapacity(), SM_CountFreeStructs(), and SM_RawUsage().
 *
 * 5) Releasing the resources of the Structure Manager returns the blocks
 *    to the system and resets some of its fields.
 *
 * 6) With possibly the exception of the allocated-record-chain field,
 *    avoid direct manipulatiion of the Structure Manager!  Use the
 *    provided interface routines.
