/* TRIE- AND CALL-VARIABLE HANDLING
   ================================ */

/*
 * The subsumptive call check/insert algorithm requires that we track both
 * variables appearing in the call (for handling nonlinearity in case we
 * have to insert the call) and bindings made to the trie variables during
 * processing (to find the answer template in case of subsumption).
 * Therefore we take the following approach.  Call variables are bound to
 * cells of the VarEnumerator array, just as is done during term
 * interning.  For noting the bindings made to variables appearing in the
 * trie, we employ another array, called TrieVarBindings[], which will
 * maintain pointers to dereferenced subterms of the call.  The Ith
 * TrieVar along a particular path is associated with TrieVarBindings[I].
 *
 * Notice that as a result of using subsumption, (1) variables in the call
 * can only be "matched" with variables in the trie, and (2) there will be
 * at least as many variables in a subsuming path of the trie as in the
 * call itself.  Therefore, given that I is the ID of the next unique
 * trievar, when a never-before seen variable is encountered in the call,
 * we bind it to the Ith cell of VarEnumerator, thusly standardizing it.
 * Likewise, TrieVarBindings[I] gets the address of the call variable.  By
 * using the same array indexer, I, we can determine from a standardized
 * call variable the first trievar that has been bound to it, and this
 * enables us to find the actual address of the call variable so that
 * additional trie variables may bind themselves to it, if necessary.

 * existing in the trie with the incoming call.  However, it applies this

 * The general strategy in pairing the call's subterms to trie symbols
 * favors, in order, 1) exact matches, 2) matches to bindings of
 * previously bound trie variables, 3) pairings with unbound trie
 * variables (causing new bindings).
 *
 * An entry for the call is created when either 1) no subsuming call
 * exists in the table, or 2) a more general (not variant) call exists,
 * but its table is incomplete.  No entry is created when either 1) a
 * variant call already exists in the table, or 2) a more general (not

       *  VarEnumerator[Num] so that we can recognize that the call variable
       *  has already been seen.

       *  When such a call variable is re-encountered, we know which
       *  trievar was the first to bind itself to this call variable: we
       *  used its index in marking the call variable when we bound it to
       *  VarEnumerator[Num].  This tagging scheme allows us to match

       *  bound itself to it, and look in that cell of the TrieVarBindings
       *  array to get the call variable's *real* address.

       *  there can be at most one trievar which exactly matches it.  An

       *  operation do we say that no variant exists.  (Just as is the case
