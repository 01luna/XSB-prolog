This directory contains files used when building Windows 2000/XP GUI 
installers for XSB using Inno Setup 5.2 (or a later version):

	http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

In order to build the installer, perform the following steps:

1. Install (or update if necesary) Inno Setup.

2. Compile XSB, if possible, in 32 bits and 64 bits, single-threaded and
multi-threaded.

2. Copy the "xsb.iss" file into your Desktop folder and open it (using
Inno Setup).

3. The "xsb.iss" file asuumes that XSB is compiled and available in the
"C:\XSB" folder. If that's not the case, edit the "xsb.iss" file and
change the definition of the variable "MyBaseDir" (around line 13) to
reflect the directory that you're using.

4. Update the XSB release number in the "xsb.iss". There should be
four occurences. Look for the strings "MyAppVerName" (around line 6),
"OutputBaseFilename" (around line 27), "VersionInfoVersion" (around
line 32), and "BeveledLabel" (around line 60). Also check the XSB
copyright information for possible updates.

5. In the Inno Setup Compiler application, run the menu command
"Build > Compile".

6. Assuming no build errors the generated installer will be found on
your Desktop inside the "Output" directory.
