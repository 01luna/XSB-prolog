    Instructions for Preparing an XSB Release
    =========================================

NOTE: Autoconf must be installed. 
      Releases can only be created under a Unix system

1. Windows NT/95/98 or DOS:

       cd build
       autoconf
   Windows:
       ./configure --with-os=windows
   DOS:
       ./configure --with-os=pcdos

   Note: you MUST run configure, or else certain important files
   (configs.h, configure.P, banner.msg)  won't be created!
   Windows users cannot run this configure script!


   Make whatever is needed to include the XSB documentation.

   Add these directories to the distribution tarball:
       
       Windows:
	   config/x86-pc-windows
       DOS:
	   config/x86-pc-pcdos

   NOTE: If you won't to configure with Oracle, ODBC, debugging support or
         if you won't local scheduling, you must use these options to the
	 configure script:

	--enable-local-scheduling   to set LOCAL_EVAL
	--with-oracle               to set ORACLE
	--enable-oracle-debug       to set both ORACLE and ORACLE_DEBUG
	--with-odbc                 to set XSB_ODBC

   Do not specify the above variables in the C++ studio or whatever studio 
   you are using! For instance: 

       ./configure --with-os=windows --enable-local-scheduling --enable-oracle


2. Unix:

   cd build
   autoconf

   NOTE: don't run ./configure! Unix users must run it by themselves!

3. ALL:

   Make sure all Prolog files have been compiled:

   cd <top XSB dir>
   make


4. ALL:

   Make whatever is needed to include the XSB documentation:
       doc?????????

   Tar up these directories (in addition to those indicated above):

       emu
       etc
       lib
       syslib
       cmplib
       packages
       examples
       build

   Add these top level files to the distribution tarball:

       FAQ
       INSTALL*
       LICENSE
       README
