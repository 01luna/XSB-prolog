    Instructions for Preparing an XSB Release
    =========================================

NOTE: Autoconf must be installed. 
      Releases can only be created under a Unix system

1. Windows NT/95/98 or DOS:

       cd build
       autoconf
   Windows:
       ./configure --with-os=windows
   DOS:
       ./configure --with-os=pcdos

   Note: you MUST run configure, or else certain important files
   (configs.h, configure.P, banner.msg)  won't be created!
   Windows users cannot run this configure script!


   Make whatever is needed to include the XSB documentation.

   Tar up or zip these directories:
       
       Windows:
	   config/x86-pc-windows
       DOS:
	   config/x86-pc-pcdos
       ALL:
	   emu
	   etc
	   lib
	   syslib
	   cmplib
	   packages
	   examples
	   build
	   doc?????????

2. Unix:

   cd build
   autoconf

   NOTE: don't run ./configure! Unix users must run it by themselves!

   Make whatever is needed to include the XSB documentation.

   Tar up these directories:

       emu
       etc
       lib
       syslib
       cmplib
